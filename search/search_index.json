We are excited to learn more about birds in B.C. along with you! You A new or experienced birder who is curious to know about: The locations in B.C. where specific bird species have been found -What species you can expect to see in a specific region -The months you would be the most likely to see certain species in specific regions Dashboard What is the dashboard for? The dashboard can be used to fill a personal curiosity about the birds you see to extend your knowledge. You can also use the dashboard to inform your travel plans within British Columbia (e.g., if there is a particular bird you want to see, you can look up where and when you are most likely to see it)! How do I use the dashboard? See \u201cHow To\u201d section for instructions on how to use the interactive features on the dashboard. What if I don\u2019t know what bird species I saw? See \u201cMore Resources\u201d section for a list of helpful links to help you identify which bird you spotted. Dataset We thank the British Columbia Breeding Bird Atlas for supplying data.

You can hover over the map to determine the location of the regions. You can search by \u201cAll\u201d regions or one region at a time. Search by Bird Species Select the species from \u201cCommon Name\u201d drop down list. The corresponding bird group will appear along with the category the species is in on the \u201cCount of Total Birds Observed\u201d card, and the number of counts on the map. Scroll down to the month bar chart to see the count observations by month. Tips When searching by one specific region and all species, you can browse through the bar chart (scroll down from the map) by hovering over a colour (one bird group) in each month to view specific species within the group that have been spotted. To find out details about one specific species from this place, click \u201cKeep Only\u201c.
