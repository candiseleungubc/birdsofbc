The mkdocs-bibtex and arithmatex issue has been fixed with a workaround upstream, so as long as mkdocs-bibtex>=0.4.0 then it should be fine. In case you have installed a version of mkdocs-bibtex from my GitHub, you can install the new upstream version with $ python3 -m pip install \"mkdocs-bibtex>=0.4\" (note that the quotation marks are important). Using Mkdocs You should modify the .md files in the docs directory. To preview the current modifications, do mkdocs serve in terminal with the directory containing the mkdocs.yml file as the current working directory, and then open up 127.0.0.1:8000 in a browser. When you're done modifying the docs , let's build a static copy of the pages by running the build.sh script. You can then open up site/index.html in your favorite browser.","title":"Second page"},{"location":"page2.html#readme","text":"","title":"README"},{"location":"page2.html#installing-mkdocs","text":"We use Mkdocs for documentation, which can be easily installed via Python's pip .
